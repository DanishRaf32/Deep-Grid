# Deep-Grid
Obtain data-driven deep learning-based reduced order model for large power system data 

This code is a part of the supplementary file of the paper "Deep learning assisted surrigate modeling of large-scale power grids" by Hanid A., Rafiq D., Nahvi S. and M.A.Bazaz, SEGAN 2023
This code simulates the AE-LSTM framework for two cases: The IEEE118 Bus system and the European high-voltage system
To try the code, create a new virtual environment as install the python packages from the requirement.txt
Then, run the Main_SM_IEEE118.ipynb file for the IEEE 118 model and Main_AELSTM_SM_IEEE1354.ipynb for the European model
