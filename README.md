# Deep-Grid
## Obtain data-driven deep learning-based reduced order model for large power system data 

### This code is a part of the paper *"Deep learning assisted surrigate modeling of large-scale power grids" by Hamid A., Rafiq D., Nahvi S. and M.A.Bazaz, Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks 2023*

This code simulates the AE-LSTM framework for two cases: The IEEE118 Bus system and the European high-voltage system
To try the code follow these steps: 
- clone the entire directory
- create a new virtual environment (via conda) and install all the python packages from the *requirement.txt* file
- Then, run the *Main_SM_IEEE118.ipynb* file for the IEEE 118 model and *Main_AELSTM_SM_IEEE1354.ipynb* for the European model
- For European model, download the data and weights file from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UqhisZXJPOcqxvCYem2luuUtfoTKkyE?usp=share_link] and place the files in the same directory
